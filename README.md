Github tutorial


Hi there lads!

This is my tutorial for Github. I am shooting to be a great software test and development engineer. I am here to learn the tools of the trade. I hope you guys can all help me. I have a pretty good background in C and C++, and some exposure to Python and Java. 

Thank you!!
